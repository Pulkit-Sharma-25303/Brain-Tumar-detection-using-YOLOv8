# Brain-Tumar-detection-using-YOLOv8 uses YOLOv8 model to detect tumours in the MRI scans.
This repository contains the implementation of a Brain Tumor Detection model using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8) deep learning object detection algorithm. The model is trained on medical images to accurately detect and localize brain tumors in MRI scans.
#Overview
Brain tumors are abnormal growths of tissue in the brain that can be life-threatening. Early detection plays a crucial role in the treatment and prognosis of patients. This project leverages YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to automatically identify brain tumors in MRI images.
#Features
Detection and localization of brain tumors in MRI images.
High-speed inference using the YOLOv8 model.
User-friendly interface for medical professionals to interact with the model.
Extendable for other medical image detection tasks.
